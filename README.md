Security Vulnerabilities:
The secret key used for session encryption (app.secret_key) should be kept confidential and not hardcoded in the source code. 
Passwords should not be stored in plain text or hashed using weak algorithms. 
The application directly checks if a username exists in the users dictionary. This can potentially lead to insecure direct object reference vulnerabilities. 
The application lacks input validation and sanitization, making it vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks. 

Secure Session Management:

Use a strong, randomly generated secret key for session encryption.
Store sensitive information like secret keys securely, such as using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management service.
Utilize a strong and secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt for password storage.
Apply proper salting and hashing techniques to protect against rainbow table attacks.
Implement secure authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), to enhance security.
Avoid exposing user-specific information directly in URLs or responses to prevent direct object reference vulnerabilities.
Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities, such as XSS and SQL injection.
Use frameworks or libraries that provide built-in mechanisms for input validation and sanitization, such as Flask-WTF for form validation in Flask applications.
Perform regular security audits and code reviews to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.
Utilize static code analysis tools and security scanners to automate vulnerability detection and ensure code quality.

By addressing these security vulnerabilities and following secure coding practices, you can significantly enhance the security of your Python web application
